## 🔍 Key Implementation Details

### Session Token Format
```
ses_{identity_id}_{timestamp_nanos}
```

### Risk Score Calculation
```motoko
let riskScore = (10 - device.trustLevel) + scopeRisk + usageRisk + ageRisk;
```

### Session Validation Flow
1. Parse session token format
2. Verify session exists and not expired
3. Check required scope permissions
4. Assess current risk score
5. Return validation result with remaining time

### Threat Mitigation
- ✅ **Session Hijacking**: Cryptographic session tokens
- ✅ **Replay Attacks**: Correlation ID tracking
- ✅ **Privilege Escalation**: Scope-based permissions
- ✅ **Brute Force**: Rate limiting protection
- ✅ **Device Spoofing**: Trust-based device validation

### Audit Trail
