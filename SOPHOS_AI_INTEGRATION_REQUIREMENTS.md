tree src/ -L 3  # or ls -la src/ recursively
```

### 2. **Existing ICP Bridge Implementation**
From your manifest, sophos_ai has `/src/interface/icp_bridge/`. Please provide:

- How sophos_ai currently starts/runs
- Any existing async runtime setup

### 5. **Architecture Components**
From the manifest, sophos_ai has:
- Ethics Framework
- Agent Core System  
- Architect Engine
- ICP Bridge Interface

Please confirm which of these exist and provide the main module files.

### 6. **Network Configuration**
- How does sophos_ai currently connect to IC?

## What I'll Create for You

Based on the 12-week integration we completed, I'll create:

1. **AI Router Bridge Client** (Rust side)
2. **Message Queue System** for reliable communication
3. **Security Context Management** with rotating sessions
4. **Push/Pull Communication Handlers**
5. **Integration with your existing components**

## Quick Start Template

If you want to start immediately, create this basic structure in sophos_ai:

```
sophos_ai/
├── src/
│   ├── interface/
│   │   ├── namora_bridge/     # New integration module
│   │   └── icp_bridge/        # Your existing ICP code
│   ├── analysis/
│   │   └── financial_predictor.rs   # AI analysis engine
│   └── main.rs
├── Cargo.toml
└── README.md
```

## Essential Rust Dependencies

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
ic-agent = "0.35"
candid = "0.10"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
anyhow = "1.0"
tracing = "0.1"
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
```

Please provide the information above and I'll create the complete integration bridge!
